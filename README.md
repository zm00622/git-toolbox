## Common Git Commands

# Push React App to Master (in Angular you do not have to initialize with git init)

git init

git add .

git commit -m"Place your commit message here"

git remote add origin "https://. "

git push -u origin master

# If having problems with the above commands

git add .

git commit

git push

# Create a New Branch

git checkout -b branch_name

# Switch to a new branch

git checkout branch_name

# Push your branch to the remote repository

git push -u origin branch_name

# Starting on a new branch with a team

First, see which branch you are on.

git remote -v 

Next, create or checkout the new branch (you checkout if the branch already exists. In the example below, Email-Notifications-1 is the new branch name that has already been created in our remote.)

git checkout Email-Notifications-1

Next, make sure your local matches your remote by pulling the remote changes

git fetch

Next, git checkout Email-Notifications-1 again and make sure your terminal has switched to that branch. Your terminal should then say something along the lines of:

Branch 'Email-Notifications-1' set up to track remote branch 'Email-Notifications-1' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'Email-Notifications-1'

Next,

git add .

Next, 

git commit -m""

Next, git push -u origin Email-Notification-1

# Cloning a Repo

https://blogs.sap.com/2019/07/12/how-to-clone-a-github-repository-to-local-mac-computer/

After cloning a repo, you may have to rename the remote origin stored in git:

git remote set-url origin "https://etc. etc."

# Git Remote Name

git remote -v

# Git Remove Remote

git remote rm origin

# Revert Changes

git revert vs git reset; Reset removes the commit while revert removes the changes but leaves the commit; Revert is safer considering we can revert a revert.

# Force Git Pull to Overwrite Local

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1125968/how-do-i-force-git-pull-to-overwrite-local-files

git fetch --all

git reset --hard origin/branch_name

# Get a list of remote branches

git branch -r

# Get a list of local branches

git branch

# Cherry Pick

git cherryâ€‘pick 

A powerful command that enables arbitrary Git commits to be picked by reference and appended to the current working HEAD. Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another.

# List staged and unstagged changes

git status

# Current Workflow at my Current Company

1.) We create our own branch and work on our tasks there (branch names are normally named after the Jira issue)

2.) We then test locally

3.) Pull from stage to sync file changes with others

4.) Fix merge conflict if a merge conflict exists

5.) Push to stage (it will then trigger the push to live functionality)

# How To Reduce Merge Conflicts

Every day, before you start coding, you need to catch up with the staging branch. One way to do this is by saving the files you have changed in your local repository in a seperate folder. Then, force overwrite your local with the remote repository.

1.) cd into / checkout the development branch

2.) git branch (to make sure you are on the stage branch)

2.) git fetch --all

3.) git reset --hard origin/development_branch


This will bring your local up to date with any current changes in the repo. This set of commands is going to overwrite your local with the remote repo on GitLab. Thus, this is why you should make sure the files you have changed are saved in a separate repo or folder before you perform the overwrite.

To implement changes from the prior day, go to the file where you saved those changes, and compare the differences with the now current repo.
